# LVGL UI Editor

This repository contains the public content related to the LVGL UI Editor.  

## Introduction

LVGL‚Äôs UI Editor is a **developer-centric** tool to help embedded UI developers create user interfaces faster and more efficiently.  

It is designed for developers who implement designs created in tools like Figma ‚Äî not for designers themselves. The editor assumes you are comfortable writing and managing code, and integrates seamlessly into your workflow, letting you switch between generated and handwritten code whenever it makes sense.  

We believe designers should work freely in creative tools like Figma. LVGL‚Äôs Editor helps developers turn those designs into maintainable, scalable embedded UIs.  

### Key Features

- **Component-oriented**: Build reusable UI components.  
- **XML-based**: Describe components in an HTML-like syntax.  
- **Runtime XML loading**: Load components from XML at runtime without recompiling.  
- **Instant preview**: See changes immediately as you edit.  
- **Figma support**: Extract styles from Figma using LVGL‚Äôs plugin.  
- **Share online**: CI actions generate a preview website from your XML.  
- **Custom widget creation**: Add C-based widgets by recompiling the editor.  
- **C export**: Export both components and widgets to C code.  
- **Built-in testing**: Create UI tests in seconds.  
- **Translations**: Manage text translations flexibly.  
- **Data binding**: Bind widgets to global data to bridge UI and application logic.
