# LVGL UI Editor

This repository contains the public content related to the LVGL UI Editor.  

## Introduction

LVGL’s UI Editor is a **developer-centric** tool to help embedded UI developers create user interfaces faster and more efficiently.  

It is designed for developers who implement designs created in tools like Figma — not for designers themselves. The editor assumes you are comfortable writing and managing code, and integrates seamlessly into your workflow, letting you switch between generated and handwritten code whenever it makes sense.  

We believe designers should work freely in creative tools like Figma. LVGL’s Editor helps developers turn those designs into maintainable, scalable embedded UIs.  

### Key Features

- **Component-oriented**: Build reusable UI components.  
- **XML-based**: Describe components in an HTML-like syntax.  
- **Runtime XML loading**: Load components from XML at runtime without recompiling.  
- **Instant preview**: See changes immediately as you edit.  
- **Figma support**: Extract styles from Figma using LVGL’s plugin.  
- **Share online**: CI actions generate a preview website from your XML.  
- **Custom widget creation**: Add C-based widgets by recompiling the editor.  
- **C export**: Export both components and widgets to C code.  
- **Built-in testing**: Create UI tests in seconds.  
- **Translations**: Manage text translations flexibly.  
- **Data binding**: Bind widgets to global data to bridge UI and application logic.

2. **Download and install the Editor**: Get the installers [here](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl_editor/releases).  
3. **Fork and clone this repository** to try the CI actions and online preview. Set `Pages` source to `GitHub Action` and enable Actions in repository settings.  
4. **Open the editor** and load the example folder.  
5. **Prepare the project**:  
   - Click `Generate Code`  
   - Click `Compile Project` to rebuild the preview with new C code.  
6. **Edit components**: Modify `button_default.xml` and save (Ctrl+S) to update the preview. Learn XML [here](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/details/xml/index.html).  
7. **Edit a widget**: Open `slider_box.xml`, edit XML and/or C code, then click `Compile Code`.  
8. **Fonts and images**: Check `globals.xml` for how these are handled.  
9. **Figma**: Open the [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/design/itmQpC9m5HessaOZFbYTwK/Example?node-id=0-1&t=oWqPUdcRyVYtRgAY-0) and duplicate it.  
10. **Use the Figma plugin**: Modify the design and update XMLs with new styles.  
11. **Try the online preview**: Push your changes, wait for CI to run, then check the preview.  
12. **Need help?** Open an issue anytime. 😊
